<h1 class="heading">Creativity also matters...</h1>
<p text-align:"center" class="para">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI came to that our creativity matters for a cool shot.Creativity is something that can change some unworthy pictures to worthy and over-creativity can do vice-versa also.A friend of mine who is also one of the reasons for me to click photos taught me to see pictures with creativity and he even made his eye pose for my picture.


We cut the one side of the water bottle and he saw through the neck end and my 18 MP eye saw through the next end and captured it.
