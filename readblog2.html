<h1 class="heading">My first effort...</h1>
<p text-align:"center" class="para">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is my first click with lot of efforts.I got an idea to click a moment with water.I went to my terrace in noon with a bottle of water.I wished to pour water and click.I took me more than 30 mins and 20 shots for the perfection.


I strongly believe that every person's perception will be different,but every one's will be liked by some people.But one should have his/her own perfection level and there should not be any excuses.The shot clicked by them should meet their own expectation on that particular shot and should be perfect on their perception.


So,I kept on clicking till I get satified and This is the final shot.
